# Week_1_Homework

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements:

    Semantic elements like main, section, and aside have been used instead of div elements.

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning:

    HTML has been cleaned up and organized.

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes:

    All image elements have alt attributes.

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order:

    All heading tags are now in order of precedence in the file and CSS organized accordingly as well.

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title:

    Title is now more informative than 'Website'

Addtional notes:
    Changes have been noted in both HTML and CSS files with comments.
